Installation
===================

clone the project:
-----------------
git clone https://github.com/tfiling/FinalProjectWrapping.git

we used git LFS extension to mange this repository due to the big size of SHAS/webapps/SHAS.war.
install git LFS on your computer which can be downloaded from: https://git-lfs.github.com/.
if git LFS is not installed the SHAS.war file, which contains the actual application, will be represented as a symbolic link and not the actual file.
make sure that SHAS/webapps/SHAS.war size is ~18MB, if is smaller than 2MB download it as instructed in the zip download instructions(alternatively you can find out why git LFS didn't work for you)


download the project as .zip file
---------------------------------

download the repository's contents as .zip file from the repository's GitHub page.
in the repository's web page browse to the file SHAS/webapps/SHAS.war.
you should see above the embedded file explorer something like: "branch: master    FinalProjectWrapping/SHAS/webapps/SHAS.war"
click "Download" button and override SHAS/webapps/SHAS.war with the file you just downloaded.
